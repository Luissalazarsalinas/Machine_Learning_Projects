In this project, we going to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model for detecting whether a cell is Parasitized or not with malaria using microscopic images.

* **Python libraries used:** TensorFlow, Keras 
* **Model Used:** Convolutional Neural Network
* **Input:** Images from blood cell
* **Output:** Predicted classes

In this project, we developed a A\B Test to detect differences statistically significant among the Promotions, and finding which (promotion) has the greatest effect on sales.

Hypothesis:

 - Null Hypothesis: Sales mean in the three promotions are equals (no variations between group).
 - Alternative Hypothesis: A least, one promotion sales' mean is different from other groups.

* **Python libraries used:**  Statsmodels, Bioinfokit, Scipy
* ** Statistical Test :**  Kruskal - Willis and Mann - Whitney 

Results:
- According to P-value(2.6741866266697816e-12 < 0.05) from the Kruskal-Wallis test, we can say that there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the hypothesis null. Therefore, the differences among the groups are statistically significants.

- The results from the Mann-Whitney test suggest that all pairwise comparations for treatments reject the null hypothesis (p-value < 0.05) and indicates statistically significant differences. In other words, the promotions affect the sales of diffrent manners. In this sense, promotion with a higher effect was promotion 1.

## Identification of corn leaf Diseases Using a deep convolutional neural network architecture by transfer learning

In this project, we are going to develop an algorithm to classify automatically images from corn leaves as healthy and unhealthy (Blights, Common Rust, and Gray Leaf Spot). In this sense, to develop the algorithm, we are going to use Xception Convolutional Neural Network architecture by the transfer learning method.
